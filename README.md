Assignment Description:
A Las Vegas gambling company, Royal Crown Casinos, started an 
online gambling option for their clients. Within the first week of its release the 
popularity of their online gaming system has taken off faster than originally 
anticipated. They have decided to monetize their system immediately. The developers 
of the original card games have all been asked to integrate their card games into a 
single combined interface with advertising and a credit system integrated into each 
game. A number of other features have also been requested.


Features:

 A combined executable that allows for the user to select any of the group's card 
games with a menu system 

 A record of time spent playing each game 

 A record of the number of cards played by the user in all games 

 A credit system with a balance shared between all the games. Credit should be 
subtracted or added in a sensible manner multiple times while the user is 
playing the card game. 

 An advertising interface that displays a random one line advertisement from an 
"advertisement.txt" file. This will update every round/turn in the game. 

 The game will redraw when the terminal is resized 

 You only have to integrate 3 games together (groups of 4 can integrate three 
games of their choosing)
